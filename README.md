# Challenge-13: E-Commerce Back End

## Description
For this assignment, I built the back-end for an e-commerce site and tested its function with Insomnia. I was able to take a working Express.js API and reconfigure it to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database. This assignment gave me a much better understanding of how you can use databases and API routes to call certain products, categories, or information in general. This was a very important assignment because E-commerce platforms are everywhere on the internet and understanding the fundamental architecture of these sites will help me better build or debug them in the future.

## Installation
To install the packages, clone this repo to your local terminal and run npm install.

## Usage
Once the packages have been installed, open your PostgreSQL and run \i db/schema.sql. Once the database has been created, exit postgres and type the command npm run seed. Once the database has been seeded, you can start the application by running npm run start.

## Test-Routes
After the server has gone live on your localhost port, you can test the API routes in another application. My tests were run in Insomnia and I would recommend that application.
